High row the boatmen row,
Floatin’ down the river the Ohio. 

The boatmen dance, the boatmen sing,
The boatmen up to ev’rything,
And when the boatman gets on shore
He spends his cash and works for more.

Then dance the boatmen dance,
O dance the boatmen dance.
O dance all night ’til broad daylight,
And go home with the gals in the mornin’.

I went on board the other day
To see what the boatmen had to say.
There I let my passion loose
An’ they cram me in the callaboose.

When the boatman blows his horn,
Look out, old man, your daughter’s gone.
He stole my sheep, he stole my goat,
He put ’em in a bag and took ’em to the boat.

The boatman is a thrifty man,
There’s none can do as the boatman can.
I never see a pretty gal in my life
But that she was a boatman’s wife.

When you go to the boatman’s ball,
Dance with your wife or not at all.
Sky-blue jacket, tarpaulin hat,
Look out, boys, for the nine-tailed cat.
